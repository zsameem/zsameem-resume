\textbf{Dear Snowflake Team,}
\vspace{1cm}


I am writing this letter in support of my application for the Software Engineer
position at your Berlin office. I am excited to apply to this position for multiple reasons. Firstly, I
find this is to be a unique opportunity to contribute to the development of
new cloud based data processing products that have a high impact and reach a
large number of customers.
Secondly, I find it very exciting to work on large scale distributed systems
and solve problems related to availability, reliability and performance.
I also see this as a unique opportunity to further develop skills in the general
area of software development by collaborating with experts at Snowflake.
I firmly believe that I possess the qualifications, skills and the drive to
excel in this position and be a valuable member of the engineering team at
Snowflake.

Currently, I am a full-time Software Engineer at EGYM GmbH. in Munich where I
develop applications that run on the Smart Strength line of devices. This
includes the graphical user interface which is based on Qt framework and written
in C++ and various other services and libraries that support our user applications.
At EGYM we get to spend a percentage of our time on innovation and learning with
which I developed a prototype peer to peer network service for distributing
software updates to machines in the field using Rust to decrease network
costs.

Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at K-Lens GmbH. for two years in Saarbr\"ucken,
Germany where I developed algorithms for image restoration and enhancement,
depth estimation and also worked on developing the user application. Most of my
work there involved writing software in C++ and some Python.
I got my Master's degree from Saarland University where I took graduate level
courses on Operating Systems, Distributed Systems. This involved course projects
where I coded major parts of an OS including user program support, a virtual
memory subsystem and an indexed file system. I also got to develop a distributed system
from scratch in C++. This has given me a good theoretical foundation in distributed systems.
I enjoyed working on the kind of problems that arise when building such systems
and is one of the reasons why I applied for this job. I believe my experience
demonstrates that I possess the necessary skills needed to be efficient and
successful in this role.

I possess good written and verbal communication skills in English. I love to learn new things.
I push myself to keep improving in the areas of software design,
software best practices and problems solving. I love to dig deeper into any
problem or technology I work with. As a person I think I am easy to work with.
I enjoy collaboration and knowledge sharing. At the same time, I am not afraid
to work independently and follow my own ideas.

I hope I have convinced you of my passion for this work. I look forward to
hearing from you.

\textbf{Sincerely}

Samim Zahoor Taray
